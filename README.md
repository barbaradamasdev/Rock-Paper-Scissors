## ‚öîÔ∏è The challenge

This is my first creation, a project in HTML, CSS and JS, a challenge from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
The objective of this challenge was to interactive with JavaScript and use it with the game Rock, Paper and Scissors.

The idea was good and I know the execution could (always) be better, but I'm rigth now very excited to do this!
